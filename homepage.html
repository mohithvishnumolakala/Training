              Imagine an international gateway where goods and merchandise flow
              across borders. Where countries lower taxes, reduce red tape, and
              eliminate road blocks. Where companies import goods and
              merchandise directly into a Free Trade Zone - and then ship
              products out duty free.<br /><br />

              The Miami Free Trade Zone connects North America, Europe and Asia
              to Latin America and the Caribbean via direct air and sea
              transportation links, plus rail and expressway. Operated by FTZ
              World Services, the 47-acre Zone (#372) saves companies money and
              time.

              FTZ World Services is your ticket to the world. We're the licensed
              operator of the Miami Free Trade Zone, the "Gateway to the
              Americas." We process as much as $1 billion in goods from more
              than 70 countries each year.<br /><br />

              A leader in free trade zone operations, FTZ works magic behind the
              scenes, offering logistical and operational excellence. FTZ's many
              services include technology, public warehousing, yard storage and
              on-site U.S. Customs. Other U.S. free trade zones also benefit
              from our technological support and operational consulting.

              FTZ World Service has the unique advantage of being the licensed
              operator of the Miami Free Trade Zone. We offer state-of-the-art
              facilities and a stellar track record in zone management, plus
              technological support, warehousing, and storage. Because FTZ
              understands U.S. Customs rules, we can use our software and
              logistical expertise to speed up your paperwork, remove road
              blocks, and get products to market cheaper and faster. We save
              companies across multiple industries thousands of dollars per
              month in fees. We'll give you less to manage and more dollars to
              keep in your pocket.
